# odin-recipes
First attempt on the Odin recipes challenge.

Overall, it was a very useful first project. Step learning curve with html but enjoyable. Found it very useful to build the muscle memory in using git commands. I made multiple error in correctly referencing the img folder in reference to the current directory I was working on. But, it is a lesson well learned.

I reviewed other submissions for the course. It seems people are very good grasp on css which I look forward to learning.

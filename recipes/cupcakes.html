    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 unfrosted cupcakes, cooled.</li>
        <li>1(16 ounce) package prepared vanilla frosting</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Lambs:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large marshmallows, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>5 black licorice laces</li>
        <li>1(10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows</li>
        <li>24 candy eyeballs</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Directions</b></p>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
        <p>Frost each cupcake with an even layer of frosting using a spatula or a palette knife</p>

        <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
        <p>Use a skewer to poke 2 holes in the top end of each marshmallow half for the ears. Poke 2 holes at the
            bottom of the front side for each of the nostrils.</p>

        <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
        <p>Cut the black licorice laces into short lengths: 24 small pieces for the nostrils and thirty-six 1/3-inch
            lengths for the ears and tails. Stick the shorter licorice pieces into the marshmallows where you've poked
            holes for the nostrils. Stick 24 of the longer pieces into the marshmallows where you've poked holes for the
            ears. Attach 1 marshmallow head to each cupcake.</p>

        <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
        <p>Cover cupcakes with mini marshmallows, sticking them to the frosting flat-side down. Leave space on the
            opposite side of the head to attach the tail. Poke a hole there using a skewer, then stick in the remaining
            licorice pieces for the tails.</p>

        <dt><b>Step 5</b></dt>
        <p>Spread the backs of two candy eyeballs with a bir of frosting. Attach to the marshmallow, positioning above
            the nose. Repeat with remaining eyeballs.</p>
